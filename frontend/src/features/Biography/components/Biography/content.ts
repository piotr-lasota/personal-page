      After realizing that mechanical engineering is not my thing I decided
      to deep dive into professional software development. And it was a
      head-first dive. I quit my well-paid job, placed all my eggs in one
      basket, and decided that if I&apos;m to fail miserably then at least
      it will be trying to do something that I wanted to try for a long
      time. Luckily this never happened. I fell in love with everything
      code(although it was unrequited love at first) and gradually gained
      skills and knowledge to become an autonomous engineer. I try to master
      my craft almost every day to remain able to adapt to every project.

      Having an engineering degree in my hand, I started another internship
      designing casings for dry resin electric transformers. It was one of
      the first times in my life I encountered programming. As this was a
      manual, repetitive process it quickly became boring and numbing. I
      started looking for ways to automate the repetitive bits and found out
      that the 3D CAD that I used supported VB macros. Yuck...! But it
      worked! From that time on I tried automating literally everything
      while at the same time starting a full-time-job in railroad
      engineering. Unfortunately gaining skills needed to become an actual
      software engineer while at the same time designing fire-safety systems
      and motor beams for the Pendolino trains proved to be too much do to
      in parallel and I began to experience the symptoms of burnout.

      Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice... Oh, what an adventure
      this was! I was lucky enough to meet some of the most intriguing
      professors and students and suffer the most anti-social ones, all
      within one city. Despite being a mechanical engineering student, I
      never felt great designing mechanical systems. I quickly found out
      that the aspects that I felt comfortable with were the most abstract
      ones. Modeling, mapping, calculation, analysis. It took several years
      for me to find out that those will be the ones that will prove most
      useful in the future.
